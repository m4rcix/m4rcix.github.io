This blogpost contains my writeups for the CrySyS Security Challenge 2022!

Flags are `HIDDEN` until the end of the semester due to University reasons.

The tables below contain my solution for some of the challenges. I did not managed to solve a lot, especially from the Crypto category, but since I suck at crypto, this was expected. The Solved column indicates the challenges I managed to solve during the competition.
