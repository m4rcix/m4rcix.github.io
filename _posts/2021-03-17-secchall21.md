This blogpost contains my writeups for the CrySyS Security Challenge 2021!

Flags are `HIDDEN` until the end of the semester due to University reasons.

The tables below contain my solution for some of the challenges. I did not managed to solve a lot, but plan on solving some more until they are available. The Solved column indicates the challenges I managed to solve during the challenge period.
