## Description

You have sneaked a peek (and you happen to have photographic memory) at the phone of a colleague.

He is a bit of a weeb, but you know he doesn’t actually speak Japanese.

What could this mean on his phone?

## Solution

Looking at the picture, we can see the guy used Google Japanese Input to write that monstrosity out. So I guess why not, set the keyboard to the same layout on my phone, and started going ham in the Notes section of my phone. I soon realized two things:
- It was like writing sms "Back in my day"
- The picture also had an "sms-pad"

Putting these two together, I started looking at what the output was, how it was achieved on the Japanese Input, then mirrored it to the sms-pad. One-by-one, I got the letters of the flag, which was:
```
cd21{HIDDEN}
```
