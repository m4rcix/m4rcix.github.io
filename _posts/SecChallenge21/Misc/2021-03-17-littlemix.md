## Solution

This challenge was a mini-quiz, with some "trivia" questions from all six categories present in the SecChallenge. Most of them are simple questions e.g. basic XOR in the crypto section. All you have to do here, is answer all 18 questions, and you get the flag. That simple. The only part I struggled with initially, was where you had to reverse a 'basic' x86 code. But after doing some research on x86 Opcodes, I was able to solve it even by hand, on paper (!). If you want the easy way out, just click [this](https://www.google.com/) :)

The acquired flag is:
```
cd21{HIDDEN}
```
