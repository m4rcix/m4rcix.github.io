## Solution

### 0x1 reversing

The source code wasn't given, although inspecting the site, everything is done using client-side javascript (YAY). So I started to reverse the source code, and quickly realized, that the game accesses scoreboard data via `firebase`. Deobfuscating the code, we can see, that the database is stored in a collection named `scoreboard`.

### 0x2 getting the flag

Reading through the firebase [documentations](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/get-data), we acquire the necessary skills in order to get the flag. The only thing left to figure out, where the flag is being stored. The first educated guess works, and we can acquire the flag by running:
```js
flag = await db.collection("scoreboard").doc("flag").get()

flag.data()
```

The acquired flag is:
```
cd22{HIDDEN}
```
