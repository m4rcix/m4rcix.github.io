## Description

We've managed to save magnetic tape from the bombarded remains of our capital. Our last hope in the fight against the dark side. But it is encrypted and even our sharpest engineers were unable to crack the code.

Could you acquire the flag and save our humble species with it?

## Solution

First things first, what file are we looking at. Running `file` on it, gives us the following answer:
```
magnetic-tape.dd: DOS/MBR boot sector; partition 1 : ID=0xee, start-CHS (0x0,0,2), end-CHS (0x3ff,255,63), startsector 1, 40959 sectors, extended partition table (last)
```

Ok, so we are looking at some sort of disk image. Running `binwalk` on it we can see, that there is a LUKS image inside, which we can extract using `dd`:
```bash
dd if=magnetic-tape.dd of=luks.part skip=2048 count=38878
```
LUKS is a way of encrypting disks on Linux, so we are going to need a key if we want to progress further. Luckily for us, we hit the jackpot on the first try. Running `strings` on the original file gives us tons of gibberish (as usual) and this:
```
The key is:down with the separatists
```

Using `cryptsetup`, we can open the partition:
```bash
cryptsetup open --type luks luks.part luks.opened
```

Mounting the opened partition, aaaaaaaaaand, nothing. I was puzzled for a minute. But luckily we hit the jackpot twice in a row. Where could they hide the flag if not in a file? Of cource it will be in the opened partition.
Running `strings` on it yields us the flag.

```
cd22{HIDDEN}
```
