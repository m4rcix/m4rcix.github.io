## Solution

### 0x1 basic information

Starting the binary, the goal seems simple: enter the correct answers, and something will happen, hopefully we get the flag. Digging deeper using `GDB`, we see, that the challenge uses `strcmp` in order to check, if the answer we provided is correct. I have looked at the source code using `Ghidra` as well, but seemed like the strings are somewhat obfuscated, so I tried going another way, which turned out to be a great idea.


### 0x2 solution

Since we are running this program on our own machine, noone is stopping us from modifying the containts of the registers. This lets us save a ton of work. Let the program deobfuscate the correct answer for itself, then right before the call to `strcmp` we can just steal it.

The challenge name suggests, that we are going to have to do this a couple of times, so I went ahead and automated it using `gdb scripts`. To not present you a one-click solution, the `gdb script` is removed from this writeup, however with the above described method, one should be able to replicate my solution.


The acquired flag is:
```
cd22{HIDDEN}
```
