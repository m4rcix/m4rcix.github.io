## Description

I just found this weird gif-like file:
```bash
wget https://www.crysys.hu/downloads/misc/movie.apng
```

Here, take a look for yourself.

## Solution

This is indeed a weird looking file, I haven't seen this extension before, and I cannot open it with anything, so I started googling. The creator didn't troll us with the extension, as it is an Animated PNG, hence `apng`. The format of these files are quite the same as PNGs, except they contain additional `fcTL` and `fdAT` chunks. `fcTL` chunks are responsible for animating the frames, while `fdAT` chunks hold the data, similarly to `IDAT` chunks. Looking at the available information online I found a tool called [TweakPNG](http://entropymine.com/jason/tweakpng/). Its quite an ancient one, but with `wine` we can run it even on Linux, and it lets us inspect the chunks of our file.

Scanning through the chunks, one chunk in particular stood out, since it had many `fdAT` chunks after each other, while the rest of the file followed a nice structure: One `fcTL` chunk followed by an `fdAT` chunk. Looking into how to disassemble the `APNG` into separate `PNGs` I've found the tool called `apngdis`.

Using that tool I split up the original file into many still `png` images:
```bash
apngdis movie.apng
```
Using another tool called `pngcheck`, and a bit of python, we can find the file, that has those extra chunks:
```python
from pwn import *
import re

for i in range(1, 429):
	length = len(str(i))
	filename = f'frames/apngframe{"0" * (3 - length)}{i}.png'
	with process(["pngcheck", "-vf", filename], level = "CRITICAL") as p:
		output = p.recvall().decode()
		chunk_count = re.findall(r'[0-9]* chunks', output)[0].split(' ')[0]
		
		print(f'{filename}: {chunk_count} chunks')
```
Indeed, there is a file with much higher chunk count then the others.
Inspecting that file using `zsteg`, we can see, that there is a `jpeg` hidden inside our `png` file, which we can extract using:
```bash
zsteg 129.png -E b1,b,lsb,xy > hidden.jpg
```

![image](/media/sc22/misc/goat/hidden.jpg)

From here, we can advance further. Checking basic stuff on this JPEG, namely using `strings` and `binwalk` we can see, that it contains a password, as well as a hidden zip file inside of it. We can extract it using `dd` once again:
```
dd if=hidden.jpg of=hidden.zip bs=1 skip=5454
```
After unzipping, we get an `mp3` file. Playing it we can hear a weird crackling noise. Checking it up in `Audacity` we can see a hidden message:
```
cd22{HIDDEN}
```
